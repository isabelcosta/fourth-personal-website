**[Hopperx1 London (conference)](https://community.anitab.org/event/hopperx1-london/) / London, UK / June 14th, 2019**

Because I know contributing to Open Source can be a bit intimidating, I wanted to share how one could start their journey and what is available out there to get started. In this talk, I talked about why contibuting to open source can be very beneficial for one's career, where one could get started and how they could start, as there are many ways to contribute to Open Source.

### Intro to Open Source
**[AnitaB.org Community Webinar](https://community.anitab.org/event/intro-to-open-source/) / Remote / May 15th, 2020**

In this talk, I co-presented with my fellow AnitaB.org Open Source admins, [Anna Bauza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-bauza/) and [Maybellin Burgos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maysburgos/), about how to start contributing to Open Source. We talked about our experiences in Open Source, benefits of contributing, ways to get started with or without programs, different ways to contribute to an open source project and opportunities at AnitaB.org Open Source.

### Open Source practices we can apply at work 
**GeoPhy / Remote / November 20th, 2019**

In this talk, I started describing the scenario we face when working in an open source environment. After that, I  elaborated on 2 very important concepts when working on open source projects, documentation and transparency. I ended up giving examples of little things we can do every day to improve knowledge sharing and also promote open communication for the benefit of the different teams, level of experience and the company.

### Journey as a Google Summer of Code student 
**[Systers TechTalks (webinar)](http://www.cvent.com/events/systers-techtalks-journey-as-a-google-summer-of-code-student/event-summary-87be2bd07b694fc6ac41a63045b297b6.aspx) / Remote / March 7th, 2019 / [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/isabelcmdcosta/journey-as-a-google-summer-of-code-student-with-systers) / [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL_dy64I13E)**

In this talk, I shared my experience as a Google Summer of Code student with Systers Open Source community, since I applied this community until I finished the program and remained in the community as a maintainer. I shared the process of getting prepared to apply and then how the actual program was after being accepted. I also showed how I contributed to Systers Open Source community with more than code, because Open Source is not just about code and has a place for everyone.

### Teach yourself Programming
**[AnitaB.org Community Webinar](https://community.anitab.org/event/anitab-org-community-webinar-teach-yourself-programming/) / Remote / February 24th, April 25th 2019**

In this webinar I had the pleasure to do the talk together with [Aliaksandra Sankova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alsank). We talk about how to teach yourself programming for free, sharing multiple resources for different types of learners and coding paths one can take. We also discussed how to prepare for interviews and about how to get started with contributing to Open Source. In the end we hosted a Q&A session.

From contributing to Open Source, as a contributor, I had to work on projects I didn’t know much about, as a maintainer I had to make sure the project was ready and for other contributors. In this talk, I shared my learnings and perspective from working in Open Source is in both sides, while sharing some tips on how to start contributing to a new project and keeping a project beginner friendly.
