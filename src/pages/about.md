### Olá 👋🏾

I'm Isabel, a **Software Engineer** from Portugal 🇵🇹. I enjoy giving back to the community by helping people get started with **Open Source** and in tech through **mentorship**.

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at Globality in the UK. I'm focused on backend engineering. Previously, I did a little bit of full stack, backend, and android development.

I’m also an admin at [AnitaB.org Open Source](https://github.com/anitab-org) community and help maintain its projects including both backend and android repositories of the Mentorship System. What I’ve been enjoying the most about being a maintainer is to manage the project contributions and, at the same time, help newcomers making their first contribution to open source, while providing a safe environment for them to learn, with the help from the community.

Occasionally, I write blog [~/posts](/posts/) ✍🏾  and present [~/talks](/talks/) 🎙️, mostly about Open Source. I also do other volunteer [~/work](/work/) 👐🏾 via mostly mentoring.

On another note, here's an avocado seed I started taking care of on May 12, 2021. This is my 4th attempt after coming to the UK. I succeeded once in Portugal, would like to repeat the same achievement 🌱

🎲 If I could share something, that I think does good for the world, it would be [Special Books by Special Kids](https://www.youtube.com/c/SpecialBooksbySpecialKids/about) youtube channel.
