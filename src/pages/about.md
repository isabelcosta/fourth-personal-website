### Ol√° üëãüèæ

I'm Isabel, a Software Engineer from Portugal.

I really like the process of software development, including coding, documentation, testing, code reviews, communicating with peers within teams, thinking about solutions to problems, etc. I like to learn about software development best practices and apply them to my work, regardless of the technology I‚Äôm working with.

I also really giving back to the community by helping people getting started with open source and in tech through mentoring.

### üåÖ Open Source

In 2018 I was accepted into the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program with [AnitaB.org Open Source Community](https://github.com/anitab-org), in which I proposed [Mentorship System](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6592097335377920/) project. During this program, I started to really like being involved with **Open Source** projects and communities. I loved that I got to work on this project from scratch.

At the moment, I‚Äôm an admin at the community and help maintain it's projects including both backend and android repositories of the Mentorship System. What I‚Äôve been enjoying the most about being a maintainer is to manage the project contributions and, at the same time, help newcomers making their first contribution to open source, while providing a safe environment for them to learn, with the help from the community.

### üéì Education

I‚Äôve graduated from Bachelors (2015) and Masters degree (2018) of **Telecommunication and Informatics Engineering** at [T√©cnico Lisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/). I‚Äôve developed my Master's thesis [_Private Reactive Multipath Communication Middleware_](https://github.com/inesc-id/Premium) at [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/), which combines multipath communication and route monitoring to react to hijacking attacks.

### üíº Work

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at Globality, focused on backend working with Python. Previously, I did a little bit of full stack, backend and android development. You can learn more about my professional history on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabelcmdcosta).
