A couple of years ago I saw [this great blog post](https://peopleofcolorintech.com/articles/where-to-find-free-stock-photos-with-people-of-color/) from [peopleofcolorintech.com](https://peopleofcolorintech.com/) about stock photos with people of color in it. I found this amazing! I never thought about using my blog posts or other types of public content to spread more visual representations of people of color.

- [Where To Find Free Stock Photos With People of Color - POCIT](http://peopleofcolorintech.com/articles/where-to-find-free-stock-photos-with-people-of-color/)

After reading this, I became aware of the existence of pictures/illustrations I could use that include people of color in online content such as blogs, presentations, promotion flyers, etc. I understood I could use them as a way to increase the representation of women of color in online content, more specifically related to the Tech industry.

Since I became aware of this when I include pictures of people in my blog posts I try to always include people of color on it.

Here are three resources that I am always aware of when looking at stock photos for my blog posts:

-   [Women of color in tech chat](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wocintechchat)
-   [CreateHER Stock](https://createherstock.com/)
-   [Illustration of Black people](https://www.blackillustrations.com/)

I mostly use photos from [WOCinTech Chat](http://wocintechchat.com/), but I always have in mind all of these resources. In fact the image from this blog post is from #WOCinTech Chat.

Thank you for reading this, I hope you find these useful and consider using these resources when appropriate.
