My current website is build with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

This is originally a fork of [github.com/andy-piccalilli/hylia](https://github.com/andy-piccalilli/hylia)




I use `source` branch to have my source code and master branch is where I have the files generated during build into `dist` folder.
