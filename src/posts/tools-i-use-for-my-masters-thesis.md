![Example of my organization on OneNote](/images/thesis-onenote-tool.png)

During Master’s thesis, I use a lot of tools to organize my thoughts, relevant information and resources related to my research. These do not include tools that I use for development/coding, it is only refers to things related with writing of the Dissertation and notes I take.

### OneNote

[OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/) is the main tool I use to write all my thoughts related to my thesis, and what is discussed at the meetings with my supervisors. I use the Windows app, because of its simplicity and the few features it has. It opens very quickly on my computer. I use a section for the thesis and then I organize all information (e.g.: notes from the meetings) in pages and subpages for each meeting with my supervisors, and other related stuff.

### TeXstudio

I use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) to write my thesis. [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) is the tool I use to write the document offline. The implementation of latex that I use is [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/), which I needed to work on TeXstudio. There are other tools useful to write LaTeX documents, which work online and allow real-time collaboration, such as, [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) and [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/). When I have to work on a smaller document and need to collaborate in real-time, I tend to use Overleaf.

### Mendeley

I use [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) to save all papers related to the thesis. I love this tool because I can easily browse specific keywords on all the papers. I also highlight all the important parts from the papers, so that I can review later. As a side note if you’re beginning a Dissertation and want to search for papers, these sites may help you finding them: [IEEE Xplore Digital Library](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/); [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/); [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/).

### Dropbox

I use [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) to share all the versions of the dissertation and project documents. So that my supervisors can track my progress and review my work. I also use [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) to save illustrations, which I create with the next tool, or [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) documents that may be shared with others.

### Draw.io

I use [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) to build diagrams and illustrations to better explain ideas and concepts. I feel this is very easy to use and allows me to create simple diagrams very quickly. I save these diagrams on my [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/).

### Github

I use [Github](https://github.com/) Wiki and Issues features to track my research and document what I learn on topics and projects related to the thesis. This is shared with my supervisors so they can easily access it and give feedback.
