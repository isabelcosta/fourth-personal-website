These are some motivational tweets I saved to motivate me to blog and ease up my insecurities about blogging. Hope this helps other newbies at blogging!

I was inspired to share this because of the [#CNC2018](https://2018.codenewbie.org/) Blog More challenge from [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/).

#### Una Kravets

What [Una Kravets](https://medium.com/u/a6dfab4de95e) say here really resonates with me because when I took notes at school, I really would come to appreciate it during the phase of exams and tests.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A great way to learn a concept is to write a blog post about it<br><br>‚úçÔ∏è Remember taking notes in school?<br><br>It&#39;s like that, but more polished, organized, &amp; filled with links + your own definitions (which helps you think it through)<br><br>Blogging = public notes u can reference &amp; share üòé</p>&mdash; Una Kravets üë©üèª‚Äçüíª (@Una) <a href="https://twitter.com/Una/status/949322814686973952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

#### Craig Russell

I really needed to see this tweet! At first, I would get really concerned if an idea I had for a post was already out there on the internet. That would really make me give up writing the blog post. Despite my feeling, when I look at this thread I feel much better, because what [Craig Russell](https://medium.com/u/e70c655d45e1) says makes sense to me.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Things I consider before writing a blog post <br><br>‚úîÔ∏è Is this something I find interesting<br>‚úîÔ∏è Is this something I found difficult to learn<br>‚úîÔ∏è Do I want others to know about it<br><br>Things I don&#39;t consider before writing a blog post<br><br>‚ùå Has someone else already written about it</p>&mdash; Craig Russell (@trionkidnapper) <a href="https://twitter.com/trionkidnapper/status/952498150660505600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you have something you want to blog about, do it.<br><br>Don&#39;t hesitate because someone got there first.</p>&mdash; Craig Russell (@trionkidnapper) <a href="https://twitter.com/trionkidnapper/status/952498164300435456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

#### Shubheksha

This is an awesome thread about the insecurity of having to know everything, and the reach for the perfect blog post, that can cause you to never publish a drafted post. [Shubheksha](https://medium.com/u/c98f56800747) gets really candid about this and really helps me to overcome the fear of publishing posts.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gentle reminder: you don&#39;t have to know everything about a topic or write a perfect blogpost with no flaws for it to see the light of the day.</p>&mdash; Shubheksha ‚ú® (@ScribblingOn) <a href="https://twitter.com/ScribblingOn/status/957499377165070336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve obsessed over this &amp; wasted enough time to realise that it&#39;s harming me in more than one way. <br><br>What I gain from writing that post is far more valuable than my irrational fear of missing or presenting something incorrectly.</p>&mdash; Shubheksha ‚ú® (@ScribblingOn) <a href="https://twitter.com/ScribblingOn/status/957500230655664128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think I learnt a lot of this by seeing how <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@b0rk</a> blogs. She writes about what she&#39;s currently learning, mentions when she&#39;s not sure of something, is happy to be corrected &amp; open to having gaps filled in by other ppl.</p>&mdash; Shubheksha ‚ú® (@ScribblingOn) <a href="https://twitter.com/ScribblingOn/status/957506676969562112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

#### Christina Lee

This one reminds me that you can learn a lot from blogging, the research for the blog post topic, and the willingness to have a good blog post makes you learn more about the topic. As [Christina Lee](https://medium.com/u/72bd5082d8aa) says, this also applies for public speaking.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A pretty good description of how public speaking and writing can make you a better developer. I love the term &quot;knowledge transforming&quot; to describe this sort of process. <br><br>Excerpt from Peak, by Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool <a href="https://t.co/XjfTK407e1">pic.twitter.com/XjfTK407e1</a></p>&mdash; Christina Lee (@RunChristinaRun) <a href="https://twitter.com/RunChristinaRun/status/958015646192644096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 29, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

For now this are the tweets that I saved regarding blogging motivation. If I see others that might help, I‚Äôll add here.

Share this with anyone that might be one motivational tweet away of starting or blog more.
