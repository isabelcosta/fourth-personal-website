I'm Isabel, a **Software Engineer** from Portugal 🇵🇹, currently working at [Globality](https://www.globality.com/) in London, UK 🇬🇧.

I'm also an **instructor** for [As Raparigas do Código](https://raparigasdocodigo.pt/) organization and a **mentor** for [Black CodHer](https://blackcodher.com/) bootcamp.

I'm an **Open Source advocate**! I've served as an admin for [AnitaB.org Open Source](https://github.com/anitab-org) in the past couple of years and, at times, I [speak](/talks) and [write](/posts) about Open Source. In early 2021 and 2022, I've been recognized as a [GitHub Star](https://stars.github.com/profiles/isabelcosta) ⭐.
